# Triangulum-X

A staked, innovative, decentralized quiz platform that blends competitive gameplay with blockchain-based financial rewards and incentives. Hosts can create and publish quizzes with staked prize pools using wallet integration. Participants join using unique codes and compete in multiple elimination rounds. The final winner receives the staked prize after host approval, creating an engaging, gamified experience powered by smart contracts.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Triangulum-X transforms traditional quiz platforms into a high-stakes, blockchain-powered learning environment where knowledge meets financial incentives. By combining competitive gameplay with decentralized finance, we create an ecosystem where education becomes both engaging and profitable.

## 🔥 The Triangulum-X Vision

**Inspired by the energy of pump.fun**, this system makes learning fun, competitive, and rewarding. Stake tokens, answer questions, and win real prizes. It's simple. Learn, stake, and earn.

This is ***learn-to-earn***, but turbocharged. Users aren't just quizzing. They're investing in their knowledge. With every answer, they're not only learning faster but also earning smarter. Each round is a dopamine-fueled loop of skill, risk, and reward. The experience turns spectators into participants and participants into champions.

Where pump.fun brought tokens and memes to life, Triangulum-X brings education and strategy into the game powered by staking, wallets, and transparent smart contracts. It's a platform where curiosity pays, literally.
